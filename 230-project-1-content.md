# Phaser 
A time based maze game.
## GamePlay
In phaser you play as a ball in a maze.  The goal of course is to get to the end.
The catch is that each maze is a level and each level has an amount of time in which you can be toggled into phaser mode.
In phaser mode you can go through walls.
## Puzzle Design
all puzzles will be designed with the idea that the player needs to figure out which walls are worth traversing.
## Scoring
the more phaser time you have remaining the higher your score is.
